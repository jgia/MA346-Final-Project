Our project analyzes how variables from the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom correlate with the subjective life satisfaction scores of countries obtained 
for the World Happiness Report. We also create a linear regression model for prediction predicting life satisfaction from a select few variables in the Index of Economic 
Freedom.

If you are interested in seeing a Streamlit dashboard that explores life satisfaction by region and has interative scatter plots for comparing life satisfaction with 
4 different economic freedom variables, that dashboard can be found at the following URL: https://share.streamlit.io/jgia/ma346-final-project
